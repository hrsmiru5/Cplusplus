// Bubu has 2 boxes of candies: the first box contains $a$ candies, and the second box contains $b$ candies. His grandmother promised that every time he receives a grade of 10 in Computer Science, she will add $a$ more candies to the first box. His grandfather promised that every time he receives a 10 in Mathematics, he will add $b$ more candies to the second box. Determine the minimum total number of grades Bubu needs to receive so that the number of candies in both boxes becomes equal.
